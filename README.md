Notes: During the preparation of test cases, several edge cases were identified that could enhance the robustness and coverage of the tests. However, due to time constraints, these edge cases have not been addressed in the current implementation. Addressing them in the future would ensure a more comprehensive validation of the application.

## ðŸ“š Technology Stack

- **Cypress**: JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern for test automation to improve reusability and maintainability.
